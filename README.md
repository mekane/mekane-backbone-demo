# Backbone Demo App #

A simple demo of some of the features of Backbone.

## Branches ##

Branches are bookmarks to different parts of the demo. Check them out in order to follow the project's progress and show off more and more features of Backbone.

### P1 ###
A barebones web page with just a generic Model and some getters. 

*Demonstrates:*
   1. Basic setup of a hand-built page, library requirements (jQuery, Underscore) 
   2. Simple example of creating a model. Demo getters and setters.

### P2 ###
Add more models. Call displayEmployee with different ones. 

*Demonstrates:*
   1. Using multiple models with one view.

### P3 ###
Adds a View object. Replaces the displayEmployee function with the view render function. 

*Demonstrates:*
   1. Declaration and structure of a Backbone View.
   2. Application namespace convention (app).
   3. Using a View to update an element that already exist on the page.
   4. Using a View to track changes to a model (call set on the Model and see automatic updates).

### P4
Adds a Model class for Employees with default values. Changes the EmployeeView to use individual elements, automatically added to the DOM on creation.

*Demonstrates:*
   1. Declaration and structure of a Backbone Model class. Default values.
   2. Using a View that sets up and updates its own element.
   3. Multiple views and multiple models - views listen to their own models.
